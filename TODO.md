# TODOs

* Skip `undefined | null`s automatically (adding these values to the `Template` type)?
* [&#10003;] Can we modify `indentWith` so that it also takes a variadic 2nd (Curried) argument?
* [&#10003;] Is it possible to extend `Template` type to include thunks (or functions taking some context) that return a `Template` as well?
* Does an alternative to `npm-run-all` exist (that's better)?

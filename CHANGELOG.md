# CHANGELOG


## 0.2.2

* Improve unit testing setup using Mocha + Chai.
  (No impact on shipped code.)


## 0.2.1

* Declare as a CommonJS module again.
  (Making it an ES module turns out to not make it work with Deno after all.)


## 0.2.0

* Fix NPM-ignoring.
* Commit shrinkwrapping.
* Update deps.
* Declare as ES module to make it work with Deno.
* (general upkeep)
